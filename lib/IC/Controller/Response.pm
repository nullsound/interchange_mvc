=head1 NAME

IC::Controller::Response -- Simple object for representing the different
portions of a response (presumably HTTP).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IC::Controller::Response defined a simple interface for a general "response"
object; for now, the response consists of headers and a buffer.  The headers
are encapsulated within a IC::Controller::Response::Headers instance, so
refer there for more information.  The buffer holds the content that is the
actual body of the response.  It is stored as a scalar reference, to reduce
overhead of buffer manipulations by using references instead of copying lengthy
strings excessively.

=head1 USAGE

Pretty straightforward; work with the buffer as an attribute, and use the underlying
headers object to manipulate the response headers.

  my $response = IC::Controller::Response->new;
  $response->headers->status( '200 OK' );
  $response->headers->content_type( 'text/html; charset="utf-8"' );
  $response->buffer( \$some_big_content_string );

  # You don't have to set the buffer with a scalar reference; it will still
  # store the content as a reference internally
  $response->buffer( 'I am not a reference, but I\'ll be stored as one!' );

  # The buffer, regardless of how it was set, always returns a scalar ref
  print ${ $response->buffer };

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item B<headers( [ $some_response_headers_object ] )>

Get/set the underlying IC::Controller::Response::Headers object; this is
auto-instantiated on-demand by default, so there's really little reason at
present to use it as a mutator.  Use it as an accessor, though, to get at the
headers object in order to manipulate the headers of the current response.

=item B<buffer( [ $some_scalar_or_scalar_ref ] )>

Get/set the buffer for the response object; should be set to a scalar or scalar
ref; it will B<always> return as a scalar ref, for performance reasons.
