=head1 NAME

IC::View::TST -- Interchange view plugin for Text::ScriptTemplate, enabling basic ASP-style Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides support for ASP-style Perl within MVC Interchange's view processing functionality
(as implemented via B<IC::View> and B<IC::View::Base>).

While Interchange Tag Language (ITL) is still available for use within MVC Interchange, ITL does not
fit very well into an object-oriented idiom.
Furthermore, ITL itself does not really allow for use of "helper modules" effectively, as the Interchange
Safe module preparation is not fully exposed with a clean interface.  Therefore, B<IC::View::TST>
addresses this issues directly, allowing easy use of objects and complex data structures within views,
and implementing support for the "helper module" interface (see B<IC::Controller::HelperBase>).

See B<Text::ScriptTemplate> for details about the view language itself.  It's quite simple and easy to
learn.

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the usual things inherited from B<IC::View::Base>, the following method is implemented
within B<IC::View::TST>:

=over

=item B<render( $view_filename, $marshal_hash )>

Will attempt to render the file specified by I<$view_filename> using B<Text::ScriptTemplate>, using
Safe-like compartmentalization to prevent variables from bleeding from one iteration to the next.
Unlike Safe, this compartment imposes no restrictions on operations. The name/value pairs specified
in the I<$marshal_hash> hashref will be marshaled into the compartment, meaning that they are
available as local variables within the embedded Perl.  In addition, the routines exported by modules
listed in the B<helper_modules()> attribute will also be imported into the Safe compartment.

The resulting content from this operation will, as usual go to the B<content()> attribute of the
B<IC::View::TST> instance.
